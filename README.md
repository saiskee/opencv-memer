# Memify

An app to turn yourself (or anyone for that matter) into a meme. It takes in a live webcam feed and displays the current locations of everyoneâ€™s facial features. When satisfied, press the relevant key (eg. p for thug lyf) to turn yourself into the meme.

Uses OpenCV, numpy and a bit of command line stuff (ffmpeg).

To run directly (no setup/ compilation/ libraries etc. required), extract Memify Just Run.zip and Run dist->Memify->Memify  
(This works on macOS for sure. Can't say anything about Linux. Does NOT work on Windows. A pyinstaller .spec file is included if someone wants to make a Windows/Linux version of the file.)

How to add a meme:

1. Create a function for the meme.
  1. Declare function with the shown parameters:  
def meme1(frame,faces,mouths,eyes)
  2. Import images.

Currently done using numpy
  4. Export the frame if wanted.  
Currently done using cv2.imwrite()
  5. Return the frame.
2. Follow code for thug lyf in capVideo(), adding new code in an else if statement.
